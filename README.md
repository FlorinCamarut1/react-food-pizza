# React + Vite

A food ordering app where you can add your name and order from the pizza menu, I build this app using React-Redux and ReactRouter.
The app simulates a simple menu where u cand chose quantity and add, remove, update cart items and order using a form wich uses a geolocation API for easy filling the adress.

You can check my app deployed at Netlify using this link: https://react-food-pizza.netlify.app/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
